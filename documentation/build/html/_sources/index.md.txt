# An Educational Game to Learn Algorithmic

**DonatelloPyzza is a simple and educational game** to help beginners **learn algorithmic and Python from high school to university**. 
A turtle can move through a grid and touch each cell until it finds the pizza.
The objective is to **build the most efficient algorithm to find the pizza with the least amount of movement** in a large 
number of maze configurations. To do this, you have access to a **simple game interface** allowing you to move your 
turtle and retrieve a feedback after each action.

This game can be used by several kind of learners:

- **for young beginners**: they can hard-code a path to help the turtle find its pizza in small predefined mazes.

- **for beginners**: they can develop intuitive heuristics to find the pizza in automatically generated mazes.

- **for intermediate or advanced developers**: they can develop a complex path finding method or AI-based solutions and assess their solution automatically on a high number of automatically generated mazes.
